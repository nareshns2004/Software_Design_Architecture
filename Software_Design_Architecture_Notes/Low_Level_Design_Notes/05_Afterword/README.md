# Afterword

## Congrats on reaching the last page!

Now that you know so much about refactoring, what are you planning to do? Here’s a bunch of ideas, if you still haven’t decided:

 * Read Joshua Kerievsky’s book <b><a href="https://refactoring.guru/ref-to-patterns-book">“Refactoring to Patterns”</a></b>.
 
 * What? Don’t you know what are the design patterns? <b><a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns">Read our section about design patterns</a></b>
 
 * Print out the <b><a href="https://refactoring.guru/files/refactoring-cheat-sheet.pdf">refactoring cheat sheet</a></b> and pin it somewhere you’ll always see it.
 
 * <b><a href="https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/feedback">Submit your feedback</a></b>. about this book and the full course.
 
 * I’d be glad to hear any feedback, even if it’s negative
