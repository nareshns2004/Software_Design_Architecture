	Figure 4.29 Structural view
	
The structural view of IT systems, as shown in Figure 4.29, consists of one or several class diagrams. Class diagrams show all relevant classes of the IT system, their relationships to each other (associations), their characteristics (attributes), and in basic terms, their behavior (methods). It is the best-known view of the object-oriented approach, and unfortunately, often the only diagram that is constructed. Class diagrams show the internal static structures of the IT system.
