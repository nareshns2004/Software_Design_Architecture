# The Static View

The static view describes the structure of business objects that are sent as message arguments from the sender to the receiver of the message (see also Messages in UML).

The following points should be taken into consideration when modeling business objects:

 * It is important to pay attention to semantic integrity. The structure and content of business objects have to be clear and easy to understand for all involved parties.
 * Information has to be coherent and all involved parties should be able to interpret it.
 * Business objects should be reusable.
 * Business objects have to be complete, so that they satisfy even rarely occurring demands and there is no room for ambiguity.

Different requirements and different modeling approaches lead to different structures of business objects. It is not possible to fulfill all demands simultaneously. The structure and scope of a business object is always a compromise; the ideal business object can never be found.
