# One Modelâ€”Two Views

For the integration of IT systems, we need to define which information needs to be exchanged and how it will be exchanged. For this reason, the system integration model consists of two different views: the process view and the static view.

In system integration, the main focus is on process steps that are significantly important for the interaction, exchange of messages, between IT systems and/or involved parties. Nevertheless, often process steps are described that do not necessarily exchange messages, but are important for the complete comprehension of the process. An example of this could be the unloading of the luggage of passengers who did not board the airplane (action unload luggage in the activity no boarding).

The static view describes the content and structure of the business objects that are exchanged between partners.

The views we use for the system integration model and the UML diagrams within each view are illustrated in Figure 5.1:
